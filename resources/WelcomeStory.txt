When you joined the secret service,
you had dreams of becoming the world’s
 greatest secret agent.
However your dreams of being 
the next 007 were shattered 
when you landed a job in the
 secret service, as a desk jockey...
Little did you know that today 
would be the day
your dreams came true,
but at the price of your biggest nightmare...
RING RING...RING RING! 
It's 3am and you answer the phone
sleepily and a little annoyed...
”Hello?! Hello?! Agent? 

This is your president, Barack Obama.
Aliens are invading Earth! 
Far beyond our stars, an alien race 
has exhausted their solar system.
Having destroyed the homes of many 
inferior species, 
the aliens have scoured their galaxy 
and have settled on us as their next target. 
We knew this was coming,
and we need you, 
to power the weapons that could save Earth.
Go to the nuclear plant and 
create as much power as possible.
Be as fast as you can, 
most of our agents are already dead 
and the aliens won't take long 
to work out what you are going to do!”
